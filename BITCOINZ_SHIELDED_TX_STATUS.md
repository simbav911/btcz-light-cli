# BitcoinZ Shielded Transaction Implementation Status

## Overview
Successfully fixed and integrated the BitcoinZ v4 shielded transaction builder, resolving all compilation issues with zcash_primitives v0.7.0.

## Completed Work

### 1. Fixed bitcoinz_v4_shielded.rs Compilation Issues
- Updated all API calls to be compatible with zcash_primitives v0.7.0
- Fixed Jubjub curve operations (removed JubjubBls12::new(), updated generator usage)
- Updated proof generation context handling
- Fixed value commitment and note encryption APIs
- Resolved all type conversion and serialization issues

### 2. Key API Updates
- Changed from `bsk.to_public()` to `PublicKey::from_private(&bsk, jubjub::SubgroupPoint::generator())`
- Updated proof generation to use `prover.new_sapling_proving_context()`
- Fixed signature and key serialization methods
- Added proper type parameters for note encryption

### 3. Integration in lightwallet.rs
- Integrated the BitcoinZShieldedBuilder into the main transaction flow
- Added detection for shielded transaction types
- Created fallback logic that uses the custom builder for shielded transactions
- Maintained backward compatibility with transparent-only transactions

## Current Status

### Working Features
- ✅ Transparent-to-transparent (t→t) transactions fully working
- ✅ Shielded transaction builder compiles and is integrated
- ✅ Proper BitcoinZ binding signature algorithm implemented (64-byte message)
- ✅ Transaction type detection and routing

### Limitations
- ⚠️ Shielded spends (z→t, z→z) need wallet data integration
- ⚠️ Shielded outputs (t→z, z→z) need proper note creation
- ⚠️ Placeholder values used for diversifier and merkle paths

## Technical Details

### BitcoinZ Binding Signature
The key difference between Zcash and BitcoinZ:
- **Zcash**: `sign(bsk, sighash)` - 32-byte message
- **BitcoinZ**: `sign(bsk, bvk || sighash)` - 64-byte message

Our implementation correctly handles this by:
```rust
fn compute_bitcoinz_binding_signature(
    bsk: &PrivateKey,
    bvk: &PublicKey, 
    sighash: &[u8; 32],
) -> Result<Signature, String> {
    let mut message = [0u8; 64];
    message[..32].copy_from_slice(&bvk.to_bytes());
    message[32..].copy_from_slice(sighash);
    Ok(bsk.sign(&message, &mut rng, jubjub::SubgroupPoint::generator()))
}
```

## Next Steps

To fully enable shielded transactions, the following integration work is needed:

1. **Wallet Data Integration**
   - Connect shielded note selection from wallet
   - Proper merkle path generation from witnesses
   - Real diversifier values from addresses

2. **Note Management**
   - Implement proper note creation for outputs
   - Handle change addresses for shielded transactions
   - Integrate with existing note scanning

3. **Testing**
   - Test t→z transactions (shielding)
   - Test z→t transactions (unshielding)
   - Test z→z transactions (private transfers)

## Files Modified
- `/lib/src/bitcoinz_v4_shielded.rs` - Fixed all compilation issues
- `/lib/src/lightwallet.rs` - Integrated shielded builder
- `/lib/src/lib.rs` - Re-enabled the module

## Summary
The shielded transaction infrastructure is now in place and compiling. The main remaining work is connecting it to the wallet's note management system to provide real spending keys, notes, and merkle paths instead of placeholders.
