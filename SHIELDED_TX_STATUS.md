# BitcoinZ Shielded Transaction Implementation Status

## Current Status

Successfully implemented the BitcoinZ v4 shielded transaction builder infrastructure. The builder is now integrated and being invoked for shielded transactions.

## Progress Summary

### âœ… Completed
1. Fixed all compilation issues with zcash_primitives v0.7.0
2. Implemented BitcoinZ-specific binding signature (64-byte message)
3. Integrated shielded transaction detection and routing
4. Connected wallet data to the shielded builder
5. Implemented shielded outputs with proper note encryption
6. Added change address calculation

### ðŸš§ In Progress
- Transparent input signing for shielded transactions
- The transaction is being built but rejected with "bad-txns-sapling-output-description-invalid"

## Current Issue

When testing a tâ†’z (transparent to shielded) transaction:
```
BitcoinZ: Building shielded transaction with 2 inputs and 1 outputs
BitcoinZ Builder: 2 transparent inputs, 0 transparent outputs, 0 sapling spends, 2 sapling outputs
BitcoinZ: Successfully built shielded transaction, size: 2071 bytes
Error: SendResponse { error_code: -26, error_message: "16: bad-txns-sapling-output-description-invalid" }
```

The transaction is being built but rejected by the node. The main issues are:

1. **Transparent Input Signatures**: The transparent inputs are not being signed. The script signature field is empty.

2. **Output Description Validation**: The sapling output descriptions may not be properly formatted for BitcoinZ.

## Next Steps

1. **Implement Transparent Input Signing**
   - Compute sighash for each transparent input
   - Sign with the appropriate private key
   - Insert signatures back into the transaction

2. **Verify Output Description Format**
   - Ensure the output descriptions match BitcoinZ's expected format
   - Check if there are any BitcoinZ-specific modifications needed

3. **Test Different Transaction Types**
   - tâ†’z (shielding) - currently testing
   - zâ†’t (unshielding)
   - zâ†’z (private)

## Technical Details

The shielded transaction builder (`bitcoinz_v4_shielded.rs`) is structured to:
- Handle transparent inputs and outputs
- Create sapling spend descriptions (for shielded inputs)
- Create sapling output descriptions (for shielded outputs)
- Compute the BitcoinZ-specific binding signature

The integration point in `lightwallet.rs` properly detects transaction types and routes to the custom builder for any transaction involving shielded components.
